# Roadmap – NurtalAgent-REPRO

## Milestone 0 (Design)

- Create schema for reproducibility reports.

## Milestone 1 (Prototype)
- Build pipeline that runs containerized analysis (Docker/Colab).
- Test on 2–3 simple open-source studies.
- Generate first reproducibility reports (PASS/FAIL + logs).

## Milestone 2 (Expansion)
- Automate fetching code/data from GitHub/Zenodo.
- Support more complex workflows (omics, ML pipelines).
- Deliver reproducibility reports for 5 studies.

## Milestone 3 (Community Audits)
- Launch bounties for contributors to run reproducibility checks.
- Store reports on IPFS/Arweave for transparency.
- Build reputation system for verified reproducibility agents.
